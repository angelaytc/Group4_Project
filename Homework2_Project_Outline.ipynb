        "The key indicator for commitment is the time spent per sector on 'Green Tasks' in the UK labour force (including the occupational level of the labourers),  while the success indicator is the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating for the industries and their companies and stock prices of their leading companies. \n",

        "- What are the ESG ratings of the best and worst performing companies in specific/key industries, and how does this relate to their industry’s overall ESG rating?\n",
        "- How does an industry’s ESG rating and time spent on Green Tasks correlate with the success of the sector in financial terms, such as by company stock history \n",

While we update each other through informal message on Slack as well as scheduled weekly team videocall meetings, we also manage and organise a scrumboard of our tasks and a shared drive of all documents, datasets and research references. \n",
